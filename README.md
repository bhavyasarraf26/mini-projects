# Tic-Tac-Toe

*Tic-Tac-Toe* (also called *noughts and crosses* or *Xs and Os*) is
a simple, two-player game that is traditionally played by
drawing a 3-by-3 grid on paper, and it can be played on a
computer or on a variety of media as well.

In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always
goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board
until either player has three in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid
are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os
in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and
neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game
is a draw.

# Hand-Cricket

A new way to play the same old game. *Hand-Cricket* is a game
played by many school kids for fun. It uses the concepts of
cricket and played with hands. It is a game in which two
players (here, `Player I` is `You` and `Player II` is `The Device`)
show scores on their respective fingers (here, `Player I has to enter
the number through the keyboard`). If the scores are equal, the
batsman is declared out. Else, the score of the batsman is added
to the total runs of the batting team. The game begins with a
toss and winner of toss gets to choose to be batsman or baller.
When the batsman is out, the role is swapped between batsman and
baller. The one scoring the more scores win.

# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Thread

*Stone-Paper-Scissor-Thread* is a game which everyone must have
played as a kid. A game we preferred to play the most when we had
nothing to do. Nothing but just our hands were enough to get this
game started but what if you are alone? Here it is, you can play
against the computer and you will surely enjoy it.
* `Stone` vs `Paper` -> `Paper` wins.
* `Stone` vs `Scissor` -> `Stone` wins.

# Snake-Water-Gun

*Snake-Water-Gun* is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using Java. This java project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.
* `Snake` vs `Water` -> `Snake` wins.
* `Snake` vs `Gun` -> `Gun` wins.
* `Water` vs `Gun` -> `Water` wins.

# Guess The Number

The game is quite simple. The computer is going to randomly
select an integer from 1 to 100. You'll keep guessing numbers
until you find the computer's number, and the computer will 
tell you each time if your guess was too high or
too low to help you guess the correct number.

# Turtle Race

There are five turtles racing. If you have a group of people to
play the game, each person pick a turtle and the one that reaches
the finishing line first is the winner.
